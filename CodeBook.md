# CodeBook
### Installed and loaded packages:

 - `tidyverse` 
 - `dplyr`
 
### Read train and test data:
 
 `xTrain` is used to store data in `X_train.txt`, which is fixed width file.
 
 `yTrain` is used to store the corresponding activity data in `y_train.txt` file.
 
 `subjectTrain` is used to store the subject data in `subject_train.txt` file.
 
 `trainAll` contains the column bind data of the three train data above.
 
 Similarly, for test data, the similar variables are used.
 
 The `all` variable is the combined data, comprising of train and test data. 
 
### Data for the measurements on the mean and standard deviation

 `grepl()` function is used to search "mean|std" in the feature names.
 
 `extraction` variable contains the data withthe extracted mean and std variables.
 
### Descriptive activity names

 `labeled_data` has the descriptive activity names:
 
  head(labeled_data$activity_label, n=10)
 [1] "WALKING" "WALKING" "WALKING" "WALKING" "WALKING" "WALKING" "WALKING" "WALKING" "WALKING" "WALKING"
 
### Descriptive variable names

 `labeled_data` has the descriptive variable names, as shown below:

### Data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
 `result_data` is the data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
 Here `aggregate()` function is used to calculate the average values.
